linter-tslint
=========================

This linter plugin for AtomLinter provides an interface to [tslint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint). It will be used with files that have the "TypeScript" syntax.

## Installation
Linter package must be installed in order to use this plugin. If Linter is not installed, please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter).

### tslint installation (optional if you wish to use an older version of tslint than the plugin)
Before using this plugin, you must ensure that `tslint` is installed on your system. To install `tslint`, do the following:

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) (and [npm](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager) on Linux).

1. Install `tslint` by typing the following in a terminal:
   ```
   npm install -g tslint
   ```

1. If you are using `nvm` and `zsh`, ensure that the line to load `nvm` is in `.zshenv` and not `.zshrc`.
1. Set the linter-tslint linter path setting to the location of the installed tslint

**Note:** This plugin requires `tslint` 0.4.8 or later.

Now you can proceed to install the linter-tslint plugin.

### Plugin installation

$ apm install linter-tslint
```

```
